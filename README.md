# node-youtube-title-views-update

A node script to update the title of the video with the current number of views

# Instructions

Run `npm install` to get all dependencies installed. REMEMBER! You need to have generated token already! Refer to my YouTube video for instructions on that! Also, you're responsible to keep your client secret and token safe. You won't be able to use mine because I already deleted it after the recording of the video
